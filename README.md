# STMC
the "Smart Territory Monitoring Center," an AI-based multipurpose monitoring center that revolutionizes disaster prevention, digital transformation, and safety protocols in cities. In this repo, we will share 3 of it's components
In addition to all the solution stack that we offer, the synergy that STMC creates between each of the AI-based solutions, will lead to faster emergency response times (Emergency Routing Optimization), and further boost scientific research by tracking and monitoring wildlife inside and on the edges of the city (Wildlife Monitoring). Furthermore, it could deliver substantial further investment opportunity, once the city is labeled as a Smart City.
Considering the costs and the quality of the Smart City services we're proving, our initial pricing will be at a 100k-500k USD when partnering with city municipalities to deploy our project.

A SMART TRAFFIC MONITORING PLATFORM TO RECORD INCOMING AND OUTGOING VEHICLES IN ROADS, MARKING CONGESTION, RECORDING VEHICLE TYPES, SPEED AND RECOGNIZING VIOLATIONS. BRS will be the core component in the STMC project to sugest the fastest path for emergency vehicules, thus, optimizing the emergency routing.
